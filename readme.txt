SuperNumberCruncher

UI and Game Idea by: Sijin Kim
Coded by: Junyi Min

SuperNumberCruncher is an arithmetic game with the goal of making "21" tiles under a running clock. We can tap two tiles to multiply them, and swipe to add. Making "21" tiles increase the score and also gives more in-game time. If a tile larger than 21 is created the score decreases and the in-game time is deducted.
